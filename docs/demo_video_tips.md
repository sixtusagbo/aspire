# Demo Video Tips (from Shipyard Live Session)

## The Key Insight

Judges watch demo videos FIRST. They will NOT download and test every app. Your video is the filter. If the video doesn't hook them, they never see the app.

## Structure

### First 3 Seconds: THE HOOK

This is everything. Treat it like an Instagram reel - stop the scroll.

Ideas for hooks:
- Start with the PROBLEM, not the app. "What if every ambitious woman had a personal coach turning her biggest dreams into today's to-do list?"
- Show the most satisfying moment first (confetti, goal completion stamp, streak milestone)
- Use Gabby's own words: "Help ambitious women go from dreaming to doing"
- Visual hook: show the celebration/confetti moment immediately, THEN rewind to show how we got there

Do NOT start with:
- "Hi, this is Aspire, a goal tracking app..."
- Technical architecture
- A logo screen
- Slow onboarding walkthrough

### First 30 Seconds: DELIVER THE PROMISE

Whatever you promised in the hook, show it immediately.
- Show the core loop: dream → micro-actions → daily check-in → celebration
- Make it feel FAST. Quick cuts, real results.
- Show the AI generating micro-actions from a dream - this is the "wow" moment

### Middle (30s - 2min): THE STORY

Walk through a real user story:
1. "Meet Sarah. She's dreamed of visiting Japan for 3 years."
2. She types her goal → AI breaks it into 10 micro-actions
3. Day by day, she checks them off → streaks build
4. Confetti! Goal completed. Passport stamp earned.
5. She shares her win → friend downloads the app

Show the app through this narrative, not as a feature tour.

### Premium & Monetization (2:00 - 2:30)

- Show the free trial flow
- Briefly explain: free trial hooks users, streaks retain them
- "Gabby's audience already invests in self-improvement - this is $2.99/mo"
- Show the paywall, but frame it as value, not restriction

### Close (last 15-30 seconds)

- Circle back to the hook
- End with something memorable: the passport stamp, or a confetti moment
- Tagline: "From dreaming to doing."

## Production Tips

- Keep it under 3 minutes (2:30 is ideal)
- Use screen recording with voiceover (don't show your face unless it adds value)
- Background music: upbeat, aspirational, not distracting
- Quick cuts - no watching loading screens or typing in real-time
- Use real-looking data, not "Test Goal 1"
- Show both light and dark mode briefly
- End on a high note (celebration moment)

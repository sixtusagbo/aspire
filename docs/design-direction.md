# Aspire Design Direction

**Concept:** Life Passport

The app should feel like a premium travel journal coming to life. Not a corporate goal tracker, but a personal passport collecting stamps of achievement.

---

## Domain Concepts

1. **Passport stamps** — Each completed goal is a stamp in your life's passport
2. **Micro-momentum** — Small daily actions compound into life-changing results
3. **Streak flames** — Consistency burns bright, visual language of fire and warmth
4. **Dream boards made real** — Pinning dreams that can move, track, celebrate
5. **Bucket list crossing-off** — The satisfaction of completion as celebration
6. **Sunrise energy** — Bright beginnings, golden opportunities, warm possibility

## Color Palette

| Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|-----|-------|
| Magenta (Primary) | `#F82EB3` | Primary actions, brand identity |

- **Achievement**: `#BFA35A` → `#DDC995` (gold shimmer)

## Visual Language

### Typography
- **Headlines**: Bold, confident, owning the screen (weight 700-800)
- **Hierarchy**: Strong contrast between headline and body
- **Alignment**: Left-aligned for authority, centered sparingly for celebration moments

### Depth Strategy
- **Light mode**: Subtle layered shadows, cards feel like paper
- **Dark mode**: Warm-tinted borders (`#3D2833`), minimal shadows

### Border Radius
- **Cards**: 16-20px (soft, approachable)
- **Buttons**: 25px+ (pill-shaped for primary actions)
- **Inputs**: 12-16px

### Spacing
- **Base unit**: 8px
- **Generous padding**: Don't crowd elements, let them breathe

## Signature Element

**Passport Stamp Progress Ring**

Instead of generic progress circles, each goal's progress is visualized as a stamp being filled in. When complete, it transforms into a full "passport stamp" with the goal category icon and completion date — something you'd want to collect and display.

## Defaults Avoided

| Default | Our Approach |
|---------|--------------|
| Generic progress circles | Passport-stamp-style progress indicators |
| Flat grey cards with pink accents | Warm-toned cards with subtle depth |
| Standard layouts with timid centered text | Bold asymmetric layouts, strong typography |
| Cold grey dark mode | Deep purple-black with warm undertones |
| Clinical white light mode | Warm off-white (#FDF8F5) |

## Brand Alignment

This direction aligns with Gabby Beckford's Packslight brand:
- Bold, unapologetic femininity
- Travel and adventure aesthetic
- Warm color temperature
- Confident typography
- Celebration of achievement

**The test**: If you removed the Aspire name, would this feel like Gabby's world? Travel journals, passport stamps, sunrise energy, unapologetic ambition.

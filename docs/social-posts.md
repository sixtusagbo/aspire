Day 3 of building Aspire for RevenueCat's #Shipyard2026 Hackathon!

The AI is alive! Today I shipped:

- AI-powered micro-action generation using OpenAI via Firebase Functions
- Users describe their goal, AI breaks it into actionable daily steps
- Review sheet to edit/delete AI suggestions before saving
- AI behavior setting (append to existing actions or replace them)
- Progress dashboard with stats
- Goals list with progress bars and Active/Completed filter
- Loading states for async operations

The core loop is complete: Create goal -> AI generates steps -> Complete daily actions -> Celebrate progress.

Next up: RevenueCat integration for premium features.

Day 3 of building Aspire for RevenueCat's #Shipyard2026 Hackathon!

Massive progress today. The AI is smarter and monetization is live:

AI Improvements:
- AI-powered micro-action generation using OpenAI via Firebase Functions
- AI now considers existing actions and suggests append or replace mode
- Review sheet to edit/delete AI suggestions before saving
- Action limits: 5 per goal (free) / 10 per goal (premium)

RevenueCat Integration:
- Premium subscription ($2.99/mo or $17.99/yr)
- Goal limits: 3 active goals (free) / unlimited (premium)
- Paywall screen with feature comparison
- Restore purchases support

Polish & UX:
- Custom reminders per goal (premium feature)
- App update alerts using upgrader package
- Global keyboard dismissal on tap outside
- Loading states throughout the app
- Progress dashboard with stats

The full loop works: Create goal -> AI generates steps -> Complete daily actions -> Celebrate progress -> Upgrade for more.

## Day 3

### LinkedIn

Day 3 of building Aspire for RevenueCat's #Shipyard2026 Hackathon!

Honestly, connecting Google Cloud Console to RevenueCat to import products automatically was not easy. There should be a script for this.

What I shipped today:

- AI-powered micro-action generation via Firebase Functions
- AI considers existing actions when generating new ones
- Review sheet to edit/delete AI suggestions before saving
- RevenueCat integration with paywall screen
- Premium subscriptions (monthly and yearly)
- Goal limits for free vs premium tiers
- Action limits per goal
- Custom reminders per goal (premium feature)
- App update alerts
- Keyboard dismissal on tap outside

Monetization is working now.

## Day 5

Day 5 of building Aspire for RevenueCat's #Shipyard2026 Hackathon!

Packed day. I was multitasking in the morning, cooking and coding 😂

At night, I slept off while working 😮‍💨

The app is really coming together.

Today, I shipped a new premium feature and 5 new features for both free and premium.

Today, I'll try to involve more people to test the app and I'll start preparing for submission.

## Day 9

### LinkedIn

Day 9 of building Aspire for RevenueCat's #Shipyard2026 Hackathon!

Fixed 2 bugs from user feedback yesterday.

I'm considering dropping one feature due to a performance bottleneck. Sometimes you have to cut scope to ship something polished. Problem is, I like that feature.

## Day 11 - Submitted

### LinkedIn

Aspire is officially submitted to RevenueCat's #Shipyard2026 Hackathon.

Solo build. From idea to a fully working app.

What I built: an app that helps ambitious women turn big goals into daily micro-actions. AI plans your path, gamification keeps you going, and every win gets celebrated.

What's in the app:
- AI-powered action planning
- Streaks, XP, levels
- Confetti and sound effects on every milestone
- Premium subscriptions via RevenueCat
- Light and dark mode
- Social sharing

I learned a ton building this. RevenueCat setup, prompt engineering for the right tone, generating sound effects with ElevenLabs, and most importantly - when to stop adding features and ship.

Thanks to everyone who tested the app and gave feedback. You made it better.

Now we wait.

Day 3 of building Aspire for RevenueCat's #Shipyard2026 Hackathon!

Honestly, connecting Google Cloud Console to RevenueCat to import products automatically was not easy. There should be a script for this.

What I shipped today:

- AI-powered micro-action generation via Firebase Functions
- AI considers existing actions when generating new ones
- Review sheet to edit/delete AI suggestions before saving
- RevenueCat integration with paywall screen
- Premium subscriptions (monthly and yearly)
- Goal limits for free vs premium tiers
- Action limits per goal
- Custom reminders per goal (premium feature)
- App update alerts
- Keyboard dismissal on tap outside

Monetization is working now.

Day 3 of building Aspire for RevenueCat's #Shipyard2026 Hackathon!

Honestly, connecting Google Cloud Console to RevenueCat to import products automatically was not easy. There should be a script for this.

What I shipped today:

- AI-powered micro-action generation via Firebase Functions
- AI considers existing actions when generating new ones
- Review sheet to edit/delete AI suggestions before saving
- RevenueCat integration with paywall screen
- Premium subscriptions (monthly and yearly)
- Goal limits for free vs premium tiers
- Action limits per goal
- Custom reminders per goal (premium feature)
- App update alerts
- Keyboard dismissal on tap outside

Monetization is working now.

## Day 4

### LinkedIn

Day 4 of building Aspire for RevenueCat's #Shipyard2026 Hackathon!

Today was all about design. I brought in the interface-design skill to do proper domain exploration before writing any code.

What I shipped:

- Complete UX overhaul inspired by Packslight.com (the creator's brand)
- New "Life Passport" design direction with warm, travel-inspired palette
- Deep purple-black dark mode, warm off-white light mode
- Gradient buttons with magenta-to-coral gradient and glow effect
- Centralized category colors system
- Fixed dark mode across 15+ screens
- Unified gamification bars between home and progress screens
- Updated bottom navigation with new theme

The app went from looking generic to feeling like it belongs in Gabby's world. Warm colors, bold typography, travel-journal vibes.
